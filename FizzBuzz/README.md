# FizzBuzz Problem
Consider the series of numbers beginning at start and running up to but not including end,
so for example start=1 and end=5 gives the series 1, 2, 3, 4.
Return a new String[] array containing the string form of these numbers, except for multiples of 3,
use "Fizz" instead of the number, for multiples of 5 use "Buzz", and for multiples of both 3 and 5 use "FizzBuzz".

fizzBuzz(1, 6) → {"1", "2", "Fizz", "4", "Buzz"}

fizzBuzz(1, 8) → {"1", "2", "Fizz", "4", "Buzz", "Fizz", "7"}

fizzBuzz(1, 11) → {"1", "2", "Fizz", "4", "Buzz", "Fizz", "7", "8", "Fizz", "Buzz"}
